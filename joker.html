    <h3>A Day He Woke Up</h3>
    <p>A man ran through the clearing, his breath ragged, his heart hammering against his ribs. He flailed his arms, shouting over the roar of chainsaws.
        “Stop! Stop this now!”<br>
        A logger turned, frowning. “Sir, Dr. SAPS is building a new research facility here. We have to do our work.”<br>
        The man clenched his fists, his entire body shaking. “I am Dr. SAPS! And I’m not building a damn lab anymore!”<br>
        Silence fell. The workers exchanged uneasy glances before turning toward the contractor—a broad-shouldered man with a deep scowl.<br>
        The contractor’s face darkened. “What the hell are you saying?”<br>
        Dr. SAPS staggered back, his mind spinning. The voices. The warnings. The destruction. He could still see it all.<br>
        “Your payments will be done. Everyone—get out of here. Now.”<br>
        The workers hesitated. But something in his eyes—wild, unshakable—made them step back. The contractor muttered a curse but finally raised a hand. The chainsaws are still.<br>
        A hollow silence filled the vast forest<br>
        Dr. SAPS collapsed to his knees, his hands sinking into damp earth. His vision blurred with tears. The weight of truth crushed him.<br>
        It wasn’t supposed to happen this way.<br>
        He never meant for the world to burn.<br>
        Two Hours Earlier<br>
        The warm spray of the shower barely touched his skin before he shut it off. No time to waste. Dr. SAPS moved through his morning routine at lightning speed, urgency clawing at him. As he shoved a spoonful of food into his mouth, his gaze flicked to the clock.<br>
        Damn it, I’m late.<br>
        He abandoned the rest of his meal, grabbed his bag, and rushed to the door.<br>
        Then—the world shifted.<br>
        A low, thunderous sound erupted, deep and unnatural. The walls rippled. The air thickened. His vision blurred.<br>
        Then—nothing.</p>
    <h3>Travel Of Unknown</h3>
    <p>A faint glow pierced the darkness. Dr. SAPS stirred, his eyelids fluttering open. His head throbbed, and the damp earth beneath him felt unfamiliar. He pushed himself up, scanning his surroundings. Towering trees stretched into the sky, their leaves whispering with the wind. The scent of fresh foliage filled his lungs. This was a forest. But not the one behind his house.<br>
        His wrist felt bare. He glanced down—his watch was missing. Panic surged through him.<br>
        “Is anyone there?” he called out. “Who brought me here?”<br>
        Only the rustling of leaves and distant calls of birds answered him. Monkeys darted through the trees, swinging effortlessly from branch to branch. He frowned. There were no monkeys near his home. Something was terribly wrong.<br>
        He took a deep breath, forcing himself to think logically. He had to find a way out. But every direction was an endless stretch of trees. The forest was dense, and no landmarks gave him any clue about where he was—or when. Was he teleported? Time-traveled? The thought sent a chill through him.<br>
        With no other choice, he began walking. His mind clouds more uneven thoughts of what happened. But the natural symphony of the forest was oddly soothing, momentarily distracting him from his predicament. After what felt like hours, he reached a clearing—and froze.<br>
        A magnificent city stood before him, gleaming under the sunlight. It was vast, futuristic, unlike anything he had ever seen. But his awe turned to alarm when he noticed the enormous glass wall that separated the city from the forest. It stretched endlessly in both directions and soared into the sky, nearly invisible except for the faint reflection of sunlight on its surface.<br>
        He approached cautiously, reaching out to touch the smooth, cold glass. Pollution clouded the city, thick smog clinging to the skyline. Yet, he couldn’t feel it. The wall acted as a perfect barrier, keeping the forest untouched.<br>
        His mind raced. Who could have built such a thing? How advanced was this civilization? Why was the forest caged? More importantly—what brought me here?<br>
        He followed the wall, searching for an exit. There was none. He turned back toward the city and realized something else—there were no plants. No trees. Only towering skyscrapers and industrial complexes. Strange, humanoid machines moved mechanically through the streets. Artificial intelligence.<br>
        He sucked in a sharp breath. Had he traveled to the future? Or was this a parallel universe?<br>
        Exhaustion pressed down on him, but his curiosity burned brighter, along with horror. He needed answers. He turned away from the city and ventured back into the forest, frustration weighing on his shoulders. As he walked, a distant sound caught his attention—a river.</p>
       <h3> Unknown To Be Known</h3>

       <p> Hope surged through him. Civilization always flourished near water. He ran toward the sound and soon found himself at the riverbank. The water was impossibly clear, unlike any he had seen before. He knelt, cupping it in his hands, drinking deeply. The cool liquid soothed his parched throat. He sat on a rock, thinking.<br>
        Then, an idea struck him.<br>
        If there were people in this forest, they would be near the river.<br>
        With renewed determination, he followed the river’s course, weaving through the thick undergrowth. His heart pounded as he finally spotted something on the opposite bank—a village. Smoke curled lazily from huts, and figures moved about. Relief flooded him.<br>
        Without hesitation, he jumped into the river. The current was strong but manageable. He swam across, his body protesting with fatigue. As he neared the bank, a man extended a hand to help him up.<br>
        Dr. SAPS grasped it and climbed onto the shore, but he didn’t stop to catch his breath.<br>
        “Which year is this?” he asked urgently.<br>
        The man, surprised by the question, hesitated before answering.<br>
        “2007,” he said.<br>
        Dr. SAPS felt his knees go weak. His stomach churned. That couldn’t be right.<br>
        The man led him to his home, offering him a seat. “You seem troubled,” he said. “Tell me what happened.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS took a shaky breath. “I’m Dr. SAPS from the year 2041. I think I’ve traveled through time. But this isn’t the past—it’s not even my present. Your world is different. Too different.”<br>
        The man’s expression darkened. “Dr. SAPS, you’re in the second timeline.”<br>
        A cold dread gripped him.<br>
        “I mean, the actual year is 4050.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS bolted upright, his chair scraping against the floor. His vision swam with confusion. “What… What are you saying? What timeline? I don’t understand—”<br>
        “Calm down,” the man said, motioning for him to sit. “I’ll explain everything.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS swallowed hard, his pulse pounding. He had no choice but to listen.<br>
        <br></p>
        <h3>A World In A War</h3>
        
        <p>“A war erupted in 2043. It wasn’t just a war—it was an apocalypse. Most of the population perished, leaving less than a quarter of humanity struggling to survive.<br>
        But even in the depths of destruction, some people saved the world. Yet, their salvation was only the beginning of a greater catastrophe.<br>
        The survivors bore deep scars, not just on their bodies but in their minds. Peace became a forgotten concept. Then, a hero emerged—a figure who rebuilt the world from its ruins. To many, he was more than a man; he was a god.<br>
        Some still believed in the old gods, while others rejected them entirely. But one truth remained unshaken—this hero was the only god everyone accepted. Under his influence, the world flourished once more, advancing in both technology and agriculture.<br>
        But prosperity was short-lived.<br>
        The pollution that choked the planet halted rainfall, pushing humanity to the brink again. Desperate to survive, they created an artificial atmosphere. For a time, it worked. But rapid technological advancements and unfulfilled needs led to further devastation—a second collapse.<br>
        As technology soared to unimaginable heights, some sought refuge on Mars. But a catastrophe wiped them out. Centuries later, others ventured to interstellar planets, yet many remained on Earth, clinging to what was left.<br>
        People accepted a grim truth: technology ensured survival, but nature, as they once knew it, could never return.<br>
        After a great revolution, the world split into two—the Techno World, driven by progress, and the Agro World, dedicated to restoring nature.<br>
        To shield the trees from pollution, Agro World demanded a massive glass barrier. A promise was made: nature would be revived within a year. Half of the planet was reserved for this mission, and life slowly returned.<br>
        But now, it has been a month since the last rainfall. Nature is collapsing again. Another war is upon us.<br>
        A time machine was once invented—capable of traveling only into the future. Before anyone could use it, it was banned. Its secrets were lost to time.<br>
        And yet, here I am, standing before Dr. SAPS, a man who has traveled 2009 years into the future. Unbelievable? Maybe. But in this world, nothing is impossible.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS’ mind spun, struggling to grasp the truth. But one thing was certain—he was in the future. And there was no way back.<br>
        “Is my future in danger? But how can I change the world in just two years?” he asked, frustration creeping into his voice.<br>
        Ravi, the man who had told him everything, looked away.<br>
        “My wife, Fatima, is in the Techno World. I think she can help you,” Ravi said. “I can get you there. There’s a secret exit known only to the Techno people. I meet her every day. She’ll have an idea.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS narrowed his eyes. “Why did you leave her alone?”<br>
        “She wouldn’t be safe here,” Ravi said quietly. “No one would understand my reasons.<br>”
        Dr. SAPS sighed. “That’s your problem. I have to go home. Thanks for your help.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS sighed and thanked Ravi. Together, they made their way through the dense forest. As they walked, curiosity got the better of Dr. SAPS.<br>
        “Why do people in the future have the same names as those in the past?” he asked.<br>
        Ravi glanced at him and replied, “Our name is our identity. We chose from the Hall of Memory—a monument etched with the names of those who perished in the war.”<br>
        Ravi pondered for a moment before asking, “What does your name mean?”<br>
        Dr. SAPS hesitated, his expression hardening. “I never liked my name. It’s just a short form. Let’s drop it.”<br>
        Ravi sighed in frustration but didn’t push further.<br>
        
        <h3>Meeting Of Minds</h3>
        
        <p>After some distance, they spotted a woman standing near the edge of the forest. She was stunning, yet worry lined her face. It was Charu Fatima, Ravi’s wife.<br>
        Seeing the distress in her eyes, Ravi immediately asked, “What happened?”<br>
        Fatima simply shook her head, avoiding his gaze.<br>
        Ravi introduced Dr. SAPS to her and quickly explained everything. Without hesitation, Fatima guided him toward someone who could help—Dr. Rich.<br>
        Before leaving, Dr. SAPS turned to Ravi. “I hope you win this war. Goodbye, my friend. I will never forget your help.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS then faced the towering glass wall separating the two worlds. Hidden within it was a secret door, invisible to the naked eye. He was awestruck by the technology. Yet, even the people of the Techno World didn’t seem to know why it existed.<br>
        As Dr. SAPS disappeared through the passage, Ravi turned to leave. But before he could step away, Fatima grabbed his arm.<br>
        “What’s wrong?” he asked, confused by her sudden grip.<br>
        Tears welled in her eyes as she whispered,<br>
        “I keep having this dream, Ravi. Something bad is coming—I feel it.”<br>
        Fatima sighed. “How long can we live like this? We have to choose our path. This time, I won’t leave you alone.”<br>
        “But this is our destiny,” Ravi argued. “I will change everything. I will unite the world. Don’t get involved.”<br>
        Fatima shook her head desperately. “For the past few days, I’ve felt something terrible is coming. This isn’t our duty, Ravi. Our destiny is to live—not just for ourselves, but for our child.”<br>
        Ravi had a moment of hesitation, but continued, “Don’t argue with me. Just leave this place. We need to do this. It may not be our duty, but if we can do it, then we must.”<br>
        Tears spilled down her face as he walked away. Ignoring her pleas, Ravi disappeared into the forest.<br>
        But Fatima couldn’t let him go. She followed him, staying hidden behind the trees.<br>
        As she moved deeper, lost in the forest, she noticed something disturbing—trees had been cut down. A sinking feeling filled her chest. Could this be the reason for the secret door?<br>
        Then, from a distance, she saw people logging in the forest—men who had once belonged to Agro World but had abandoned it after losing hope due to the lack of rain.<br>
        Worried, she hurried toward the nearby village just after a long search.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Last Drop That Fell</h3>
        
       <p> When her eyes caught the scenario, her heart stopped. The agricultural fields were in ruins. Crops had been trampled and destroyed.<br>
        Nearby, she overheard a few men talking. “A few hours ago, an elephant came and wrecked everything.”<br>
        Fatima’s mind raced. The trees… The elephant must have lost its home and wandered here.<br>
        But the loggers were too desperate to care. She thought that the Techno world went out of resources. Driven by greed, they made an agreement with those who left the Agro world. The villagers had lost their livelihood, and to them, the elephant was a threat. Armed with spears, a group of men set off into the forest to hunt it down.<br>
        Among them was Ravi.<br>
        Fatima’s breath hitched. Fear clutched her heart as she watched him disappear into the trees.<br>
        She collapsed to her knees, tears streaming down her face. For the first time in years, she prayed. She prayed not just for Ravi, but for hope, for an end to all of this.<br>
        As the villagers gathered, they too prayed.<br>
        Then—a single tear fell from her eyes.<br>
        At that exact moment, a raindrop touched the earth.<br>
        And somewhere in the forest, a drop of blood seeped into the ground.<br>
        Silence fell, as if the world itself had frozen.<br>
        There in the forest, a young elephant calf stumbled toward a lifeless body—its mother, lying still in the dirt. The calf nudged her gently, trying to wake her. But she would never rise again.<br>
        A few moments later, the hunting party returned from the depth of the forest.<br>
        They carried another lifeless body.<br>
        Ravi.<br>
        Fatima’s scream pierced through the air.<br>
        And then, as if the heavens had finally broken, the rain poured down.<br>
        The villagers rejoiced, dancing under the long-awaited rainfall, because they had seen many sufferings and many lives were gone for this. But Fatima stood still, broken.<br>
        She turned, her voice trembling. “Whose fault is all this?”<br>
        Dr. SAPS, his eyes darkened with sorrow, whispered, “All of this… is the law of destiny.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS arrived to bid farewell, but instead, he was met with devastation. The sight of the lifeless bodies—Ravi and the news of the fallen elephant—sent a chill through him. A deep guilt gnawed at his conscience. He walked toward Fatima, who knelt beside Ravi, her hands trembling, her tears merging with the rain-soaked earth.<br>
        “I’m sorry...” he whispered, placing a hesitant hand on her shoulder. But words were meaningless in the face of such loss. The pain in her eyes spoke of something deeper—despair, and an unbearable grief that no apology could mend.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>An Inevitable End</h3>
        
        <p>When he went to the Techno world, Dr. SAPS made his way into the city, seeking Dr. Rich. They finally met, and Dr. SAPS recounted everything about his time travel, his voice heavy with regret.<br>
        Dr. Rich sighed. “I’m truly sorry.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS narrowed his eyes. “But why?”<br>
        Dr. Rich hesitated before revealing the truth. “This... was my experiment. I thought it had failed. But it didn’t. It worked by bringing you here.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS stiffened. “What experiment?”<br>
        Dr. Rich met his gaze. “I’m from the past—your past. The year 2041, the time of the apocalypse. I conducted an experiment to return to my timeline. Let’s go together.”<br>
        Dr. SAPS was silent. He needed time to process this. Eventually, he returned to Ravi to bid farewell, but instead, he was met with devastation. He replayed the moment in his head, the tragic sequence of fate.<br>
        Ravi, driven by instinct, had rushed forward to stop the men from harming the elephant. But before he could reach them, the elephant—frantic, protective—had swung its massive trunk and lifted him into the air. It had not intended harm, only to shield its calf. Yet, in a cruel twist of fate, it hurled Ravi onto a sharp branch. The men, gripped by fear, retaliated. The elephant was slain.<br>
        A tragedy birthed from misunderstanding.<br>
        Present Day<br>
        Dr. SAPS stood under the shower, letting the water cascade over him. Yet, each drop seemed to whisper to him:<br>
        “Who are you? You care for us, yet you waste us.”<br>
        He turned off the water, still dripping, staring at his own reflection in the fogged-up mirror.<br>
        He dressed, sat at his table, and ate his meal in silence. But even then, his past haunted him. The scraps of food left on his plate seemed to echo another question:<br>
        “Who are you? You care for us, yet you waste us.”<br>
        Overwhelmed, he pushed his chair back and stormed outside. His feet carried him to a group of workers, their axes striking tree trunks with ruthless efficiency. He shouted for them to stop, his voice cracking with urgency. As they left the place, he fell to his knees, his shoulders shaking.<br>
        “Whose fault is all of this?” he whispered.<br>
        A voice—soft yet firm—rose within him:<br>
        “It is not in the hands of sole, but the attempt of whole gives the green.”<br>
        He closed his eyes. He remembered the apocalypse. The destruction. The loss. The mistakes. This truth could not be buried. The world needed to know. And so, he began to write.<br>
        A book. A message. A warning.<br>
        Yet, it was a book that would never be published. As he finished the final words, he paused. He had always believed a name was just an identity. But now, he understood—it was a legacy. And so, he signed it.<br>
        Finally, he wrote the title:<br>
        Who Am I?<br>
        Beneath it, he added:<br>
        Who are you? What are you doing? What will you do?<br>
        And then, to himself, he whispered:<br>
        Who… am… I…?<br>
